Week 3 - Day 1 
Problem Statement - I am trying to make a fun boss fighting game with bullet hell combat.

Week 3 - Day 2
I want to integrate AI into my project by utilizing it when I face bugs or standstills in my code. For example, if I can't figure out exactly why my code is not working, I can prepare a file with my code and put it into AI to help me find a solution. Similarly, 
if I want to figure out how to implement a certain feature into my game that I dont know how to implement, I can have AI teach me how to do so.
