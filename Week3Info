Week 3 - Day 1 
Problem Statement - I am trying to make a fun boss fighting game with bullet hell combat.
Important Research - I have found multiple tutorials on how to make bullet hell bosses as well as basic game design techniques that I need to refine from semester one.

Week 3 - Day 2
I want to integrate AI into my project by utilizing it when I face bugs or standstills in my code. For example, if I can't figure out exactly why my code is not working, I can prepare a file with my code and put it into AI to help me find a solution. Similarly, 
if I want to figure out how to implement a certain feature into my game that I dont know how to implement, I can have AI teach me how to do so.

Week 3 - Day 4
What do you still need to accomplish or clarify for your project to move forward?
I think I have everything pretty clearly planned out for my project, and ill make sure to adjust if anything needs changing.
What resources (data, tutorials, hardware, feedback) do you need?
I have a good set of tutorials already but if I ever need more, Youtube is a great resource.
What challenges or uncertainties are you facing right now?
Im not sure exactly how much I can do by myself, but I hope I dont have to use AI too much.
How do you plan to address these challenges?
If a task seems to out of reach I may have to adjust to something easier or allocate more time to learning.
