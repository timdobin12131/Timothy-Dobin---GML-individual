Tutorial #1: https://youtu.be/1J5EydrnIPs?si=KSaNy4PDz00aNyL9
- In this tutorial, I learned the initial basics of starting an rpg game. Starting from scratch without any previous knowledge, the main issue I faced was simply understanding what buttons did what and how to create the
  different aspects of a game. However, following along with the tutorial helped me get a good basic understanding.

- In this tutorial, I learned how to design basic real time combat, adding a slash animation as well as attacks that collide with enemies in order to do damage to them. Understanding exactly how the code worked with the 
  different variables and functions proved to be a little challenging, but I was able to look at the code and decipher it.

Tutorial #3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqmQAoPdZ2U&list=PLhIbBGhnxj5Ier75j1M9jj5xrtAaaL1_4&index=4
- In this tutorial, I learned how to implement a leveling and xp system in the game, which was a little complicated. Specifically, the order of functions and lines of code was a bit confusing to me. I have not fully completed
this tutorial yet however, as I still need to make the enemies grant the player xp.

9/12/25 - Today I faced a challenge with my dialogue in which whenever I interacted with an npc to talk to them the code would fail to read the color from the dialogue script. Putting the code into chatGPT, I was able to work 
          around this by adding more checks to make sure the color doesn't come through as undefined, and the dialogue ended up working successfully as planned.
