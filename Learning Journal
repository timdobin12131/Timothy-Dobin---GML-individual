Tutorial #1: https://youtu.be/1J5EydrnIPs?si=KSaNy4PDz00aNyL9
- In this tutorial, I learned the initial basics of starting an rpg game. Starting from scratch without any previous knowledge, the main issue I faced was simply understanding what buttons did what and how to create the
  different aspects of a game. However, following along with the tutorial helped me get a good basic understanding.

Tutorial #2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr0mqIy6DAU&list=PLhIbBGhnxj5Ier75j1M9jj5xrtAaaL1_4&index=2
- In this tutorial, I learned how to design basic real time combat, adding a slash animation as well as attacks that collide with enemies in order to do damage to them. Understanding exactly how the code worked with the 
  different variables and functions proved to be a little challenging, but I was able to look at the code and decipher it.

Tutorial #3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqmQAoPdZ2U&list=PLhIbBGhnxj5Ier75j1M9jj5xrtAaaL1_4&index=4
- In this tutorial, I learned how to implement a leveling and xp system in the game, which was a little complicated. Specifically, the order of functions and lines of code was a bit confusing to me. I have not fully completed
this tutorial yet however, as I still need to make the enemies grant the player xp.

9/12/25 - Today I faced a challenge with my dialogue in which whenever I interacted with an npc to talk to them the code would fail to read the color from the dialogue script. Putting the code into chatGPT, I was able to work 
          around this by adding more checks to make sure the color doesn't come through as undefined, and the dialogue ended up working successfully as planned.

Week of Sep. 15-19 - Throughout the week I worked on designing pickups for the character that boost damage and defense. Using sprites I found online, I successfully made the pickups. After this, 
                     I collaborated with jonathan to program projectiles that shoot at the player, and added the projectiles to boss's skillset. This progress can be seen documented in the attached screen recording.

9/23/25 - I began work on a player controlled projectile, and drafted ideas in order to allow the projectile to travel where the player is facing.
9/24/25 - I coded a projectile, however faced errors as the projectile would not go in the direction I wanted it to go. Spent the rest of the time debugging.
9/25/25 - Worked with Jonathan and Jacob to come up with a way to use switch cases in order to solve the issue
9/26/25 - Finished projectile system and now began work on it's speed and damage upon enemy collision.

9/29/25 - Began implementing projectile into game, coding how the projectile would damage the enemy upon collision
9/30/25 - Added the laser gun as an item that, upon pickup by the player, allows them to use the projectile
10/1/25 - Added a sprite for the laser gun and added a boss room
10/2/25 - Began adding sprites for the final boss
10/3/25 - Finished adding sprite for the boss
10/13/25 - Began work on coding boss, I am facing a challenge with the projectile system.
10/14/25 - Still struggling to add a 360 spread projectile.
10/15/25 - Overcame the issue using AI, and began work on improving the move
10/20/25 - Finishes the 360 burst projectile and began the next move.
10/21/25 - Created a rotating bullet pattern.
10/22/25 - Created a projectile wave that is destroyable by the player's attack.
10/23/25 - Created quadrants for the boss fight and began movement.
10/24/25 - Continued work on boss movement between quadrants.
